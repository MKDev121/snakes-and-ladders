lemme do 1 and 3 , fixes 1st


update 21:17 15/11/23
trying to do 4 , do threads , remember to self !!! NEVER USE () INSIDE THREAD DECLARATION , THAT SHIT CALLS THE FUNCTION
also do 4 the go to 2 or take rolling alone in a sepeate file and fix it
probably later is a great idea
scrap 1 ; moving to a fn kind of wrecks everything
5 is easy , just need to write when im not procastinating

update 9:11 16/11/23
fixed dice animation
need to fix loop and need a idea to think for 4
i could add a play again and quit box
loading screen itself is kinda ready as animations are done , start font engines , write text add a box to start

update 11:19 16/11/23
found out bugs in animations 
confirmationbox ready
adding loading scrren but tired 
gonna take rest now

update 10:46 17/11/23
done with loading screen 
next is confirmationbox , once text is added to it , i will start on the most frustrating threads thing , if it fails , i might even may need to redo the loop
thinking of it why not add a counter var and just remove for loop and add if conditions , that might be easier , but its a future me problem

update 16:02 17/11/23
done with roll animation
blinker is left 
need to add not rolling condition to key check
and add space bar to roll 
and merge all 
check and review 
then its done

update 23:46 17/11/23
merged dice animation fix and loop fix
merged loading screen
merged enter name screen
need to do:
merge play again and quit and confirmation boxessss 


and for bug fixes :
swapper , dice roll fix is clashing with it
yeah , fix adding roll function , somethings so broken there
name text is having null value for whatever reason

also need to do for 2 player:
name screen
1p or 2p box
then just change swapper and it should be good to go

going for 1 month halt in this , as my sems are fast approaching , till that good bye
