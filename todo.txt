trying to do 4 , do threads , remember to self !!! NEVER USE () INSIDE THREAD DECLARATION , THAT SHIT CALLS THE FUNCTION
also do 4 the go to 2 or take rolling alone in a sepeate file and fix it
probably later is a great idea
scrap 1 ; moving to a fn kind of wrecks everything
5 is easy , just need to write when im not procastinating

update 9:11 16/11/24
fixed dice animation
need to fix loop and need a idea to think for 4
i could add a play again and quit box
loading screen itself is kinda ready as animations are done , start font engines , write text add a box to start
